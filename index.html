            Philosophy can be a scary word. Some people avoid philosophy all together in fear that it is too complex. It is possible to come to great philosophical conclusions without overthinking. The key to making philosophy simple is to critically define abstract ideas to a point where all uncertainty is apparent. Once this is accomplished, it will be much easier to approach and understand more complex issues.

            "Making assumptions is an important step in solving many real-world problems" (David Fortus)
        </div>
        <p class="basic_pg">
            People rely on their ability to make assumptions to effectively come to conclusions. This can be seen in both mathematical problem solving and in everyday situations. An argument or statement that is true must be backed up by a number of premises. The only way that these premises can work with each other to prove some argument or statement is if they follow some set of rules or logic.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_pg">
            Consider this argument. <b>All apes are primates and all primates are mammals, so all apes must be mammals</b>. This argument isn't built of only the fact that apes are primates and the fact that primates are mammals. There is a third element in play. This argument assumes that the two statements combined logically imply the conclusion that all apes are mammals. All three elements are assumed to be true with no proof. Anything that is assumed to be true without proof can be used as a basis to prove other things and is called an Axiom.
        </p>

        <p class="basic_pg">
            It is important to recognize exactly what we are assuming when making an argument or claim that we believe to be true. In this example, it is assumed that the statement all apes are primates is true. No proof is provided because this statement is one of the axioms used to build other ideas. It will never be possible to prove everything so when we try to find truth, we must assume something basic to be true without any proof.

        </div>
        <div class="basic_pg">
            Hate can have serious consequences. Blind hatred towards a group of people based on nothing but prejudice has consequences and so does hating a world leader for turning a blind eye to genocide.

            "We hate persons and groups more because of who they are, than because of what they do." (Fischer, et al.)

            It is essential that we differentiate these two types of hatred. Discriminatory hatred can cause those with "lower psychological endurance... to [have] emotional outbursts" (Saha). This kind of hatred can cause serious emotional harm. Racism is an example of hatred for a group because of who they are. Racism serves no purpose as it does not attempt to address any sort of problem. Racist people use baseless stereotypes to justify hating a specific group of people.
        </div>
        <div class="basic_pg">
            The effects of hating someone for their past actions are very different. It makes a lot of sense to be highly critical of a corrupt politician. It is also the case that corrupt politicians don't change their behaviors unless they are faced with great opposition. Sometimes this type of opposition is only possible if it is backed by strong emotion. While emotions like anger are often more appropriate, hatred will have similar effects and is unavoidable in many cases.
        </div>
        <div class="basic_pg">
            Hate is a strong emotion. It isn't fair to say that nobody should ever hate anything. It is important that we are very selective with what we hate. Hate should be a response to unacceptable actions only and it should be used to influence change.

            With what we know now, it is very difficult to understand why our dreams take the form that they do. When we dream, we are experiencing an altered state of consciousness. At some point, our ancestors must have evolved to dream the way that we do. "Although dreams are intensely visual experiences, and often seem to be as vivid as life itself, dream consciousness differs from that in the waking state, most importantly in the absence of insight and self-awareness" (Rees). Anyone who has experienced a dream will say that it is a complex experience.

             Animals look and act like they do today as a result of many genetic mutations. If a genetic mutation that results in a slightly different behavior or shape of an animal increases the odds of that animal producing viable offspring, that mutation will have a higher chance of being passed on to future generations. "A classic example of extreme morphological adaptation to the environment is the neck of the giraffe..." (Simmons). The long neck of a giraffe did not come from a single genetic mutation. This adaptation is genetically complex and took millions of years to become what it is today. Giraffes only have long necks because mutations that made the neck longer helped the animals reproduce. The same can be said about the way that people dream. Our dreams are complex and are not a result of a single genetic mutation. It is highly unlikely that we evolved to dream the way that we do by chance as it is obvious that dreams at least have some sort of structure and effect on how we think.

        <div class="basic_pg">
            It can be very difficult to grasp the idea of death. Why is death so hard for people to think about? Why does the death of a human seem so much more significant than the death of an insect?
        </div>
        <div class="basic_pg">
            There are many ways that people choose to think about death. This is apparent as there are an abundance of euphemisms commonly used to describe death.

            The death of a human means more to us than a simple loss of life. There is a constant loss of life everywhere in the world. The cells in our bodies frequently die and get replaced. We may kill a dozen insects just by taking a step. Turning on the stove instantly kills thousands of bacteria.
        </div>
        <div class="important_text">
            The death of a human is only so significant to us because it is a loss of a complex consciousness.
        </div>
        <div class="basic_pg">
            The problem is that defining consciousness is so difficult. "It appears that even a complete specification of a creature in physical terms leaves unanswered the question of whether or not the creature is conscious" (Weisberg). Humanity has put a lot of resources into preventing human death and prolonging human life. If there are other creatures with comparable levels of consciousness, do they deserve the same treatment? While there are no animals that have the same conscious experience as we do, there are animals which are known to be great problem solvers and possibly experience some sort of complex consciousness.

            The common ancestor of Cephalopods (animals of the class Cephalopoda including squid and octopuses) and humans lived over 500 million years ago. Although these animals are not at all closely related to us, they are extremely intelligent, and they may experience a very complex consciousness. It is very difficult to measure the consciousness of other creatures, so we may not understand the consciousness of these animals for a long time. There have, however, been some strides in measuring human consciousness. Researchers have been able to measure "the frequency of brain waves" and found that "slow brain waves are seen in some conditions such as sleep, coma, brain death, depression, autism, brain tumors," etc. "while rapid waves are generally reported in conditions such as epilepsy, anxiety, PTSD, and drug abuse" (Roohi-Azizi, Mahtab et al.).

                This review of "classic as well as more contemporary conceptualizations of hatred" analyzes different ways that authors view hate.  This review discusses the differences between hate and other negative emotions and the long time debate over whether or not hatred is an emotion, motive, or emotional altitude syndrome. It is concluded that hate is a reaction to transgressions between groups or people.

                This publication outlines a study on the value of making assumptions in problem solving. The study consisted of participants, who all had at least a BA in physics, attempting to solve "three well-defined and one real-world problem." The participants were interviewed about their process afterwards. It was found that recognizing where assumptions should be made helped to "convert the real-world problem into a well-defined one."

            <p>
                This philosophy is based on logically analyzing different concepts to find some sort of definition that recognizes uncertainty. Fortus describes up the value of making assumptions with "Making assumptions is an important step in solving many real-world problems." This study shows the link between understanding assumptions and defining problems.

                This paper looks at work in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy of mind to develop an argument that dreams are "a more general virtual rehearsal mechanism" than a simple threat rehearsal mechanism. It argues that dreams likely play an important role in the development of human cognitive capacities. The paper also looks at whether or not dreams are truly random and provides a great argument that they are not random as the majority of dreams are somewhat realistic and contain a connected story line.

                The idea that dreams must have been selected for relies on the idea that dreams are not random. If dreams are truly random then they would not be selected for. This paper recognizes that dreams do have some structure and must have a purpose.

                Rees, Geraint, et al. composed a collection of reviews of studies on brain activity during dreaming. These reviews compare the primate visual system with areas of the brain active during sleep. The study focuses on the visual system as dreams are very visual.

                The significance of dreams in this philosophy is the fact that they are a complex human adaptation. This study focuses on how dreams are a highly visual experience and focuses on primate visual systems. Primates generally rely on their vision rather than olfaction unlike other mammals. These reviews of brain activity provide great evidence that our dreams are somewhat unique to humans and our close relatives.

            <p>
                This 1996 study looks at the evolution of modern giraffes and some of its recent ancestors and extinct relatives. The study argues that the long necks of giraffes were not selected only for an ability to reach food but for sexual preference. The morphologically similar species, <i>Giraffa jumae</i> is described to have a similar build but without an elongated skeleton. It is mentioned that modern giraffes split from <i>Giraffa jumae</i> about 1 million years ago.

                An example of a complex adaptation in the animal kingdom other than human dreaming provides some context as to how long these adaptations take. It took several hundreds of thousands of years for modern giraffes to develop the neck that they have today. While this does not prove that all complex adaptations take a very long time to develop, it provides some strong anecdotal evidence.

            "What is an Axiom? (Philosophical Definition)" <i>YouTube</i>, uploaded by Carneades.org, 22 Sep. 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSpKQfSnN44">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSpKQfSnN44.</a>
            <p>
                This video provides a simple and easy to understand explanation of the definition of axiom and the definition of definition. The video explains what an axiom is by analyzing a few examples of the connection between premises and conclusions. The idea that we should be skeptical of logical systems is brought up which is crucial to this philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since this philosophy heavily relies on the idea that all truth is based on some set of assumptions, a formal understanding of what an axiom is provided by a simple video helps to understand this philosophy. There is an explanation of axioms provided in text on the truth page. This video breaks down the definition even further by describing a few well-defined examples, making it even easier to understand.

            Wight, Kate. "36 Popular Euphemisms for Death + Examples." Cake Blog, 22 Jan. 2021, <a href="https://www.joincake.com/blog/euphemisms-for-death/">www.joincake.com/blog/euphemisms-for-death/.</a>
            <p>
                In addition to providing a list of common euphemisms for death, this article explains a few reasons why euphemisms are used for death. Wight describes death as a "part of the natural order of life" and the idea of being "death positive" as "accepting and preparing for death." The list of euphemisms are split into the categories including "Death for an Obituary or Sympathy Message," "Funny Euphemisms for Death," and "Religious Euphemisms for Death."
            </p>
            <p>
                The fact that there are so many commonly used euphemisms for death that relate to spirit and afterlife shows that people value human life. This is an important fact to establish before arguing that people value the complex consciousness of humans. This list of common euphemisms acts as evidence that people struggle with the loss of consciousness.
